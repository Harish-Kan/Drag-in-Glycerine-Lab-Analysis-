Drag in Glycerine Lab Analysis

Abstract : 
The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether the drag force on small ball bearings falling through glycerine is linear (Stokes' Law) or quadratic (Newtonian). This was achieved by developing and testing two competing theoretical models against experimental data.The experimental procedure involved dropping a ball bearing into a tall cylinder filled with glycerine. A recording device was used to measure the time it took for the ball to travel a fixed distance after it had reached terminal velocity. Specifically, timing began as the ball crossed a first reference line and ended as it crossed a second reference line further down the cylinder. This measurement was repeated multiple times for consistency. The entire experiment was then repeated, using five different ball bearings with increasing radii, with all timing measurements being recorded. After data collection, two graphs were constructed to test the two drag models: Linear Drag Test is terminal velocity versus the radius squared was created. A linear relationship here confirms the linear drag model (FD proportional v proportional r^2). Quadratic Drag Test: A plot of terminal velocity (Vt) versus the square root of the radius (squared-rooted r) was created. A linear relationship here confirms the quadratic drag model (FD proportional v^2 proportional r). This lab was done as apart of Phys 104. Data gathered by Harish Kandavell, Asa Blake-Brown, Brendan Reddi, Eilean Lochray, Jack Christoff. 

Theory : 
As a sphere falls through glycerin or any viscous fluid, it experiences gravity, buoyancy aswell as drag force. As the sphere accelerates through the glycerin, the drag increases. The drag increases until the downward force is balanced. The sphere then reaches a constant (Vt) terminal velocity. The drag that is showcased in this experiment, depends on the stokes model $$ v_T \propto \sqrt{r}$$ and the linear model $$ v_T \propto r^2$$. The cross sectional area is stated as A = 4πr^2. This is wrong as the correct version of cross-sectional area is A = πr^2. This is due to only the projected area of the sphere at hand affecting the drag. 

Prediction : 

The relationship betweeen the terminal velocity of the ball bearings and their size is predicted to be quadratic. As the radius of the spheres increase, the spheres will fall faster. This is due to it's weight increases more than the drag force that is acting on it. In this case, larger balls will have a larger terminal velocity. 


Materials and procedure 

Density : 
1260 g/cm^3 of Glycerin 
(7800 +-50)Kg/m^3



Materials

1. Ball Dropper
2. Bearings
3. Graduated Cylinder 
4. Glycerin
5. Marker
6. Distance of the bearings are 16 cm
7. Phone Camera (Projectile Motion Apparatus)
8. Phone Camera (Timer)

Procedure

1. In order to figure out the distance of the bearings. A ball should be dropped, and the ball should reach it's terminal velocity. The measurment of the distance of the bearings should be 16cm. 
2. Dip the ball dropper inside of the glycerin solution in order to reduce bubbles. In order to reduce uncertainty.
3. A recording device is used to figure out the time it takes to reach terminal velocity. The recording is started when the ball crosses the first line, and the recording ends when the ball crosses the second line. This is to ensure that the ball has reached terminal velocity. The recorder stands away (min 50cm) from the graduated cylinder and ensures the entire camera records the cylinder. Ensure the recording device is positioned perpendicular to the cylinder.
4. The ball is then dropped by the ball dropper into the glycerin, and is then recorded by the recording device. 
5. The experiment is repeated 10 differnet times, using 5 different balls of increasing radii. Each ball is dropped 2 times. This is done inorder to see how sphere size affects terminal velocity. This is also done inorder to decrease uncertainty. This is also done in order to increase accuracy inside of the experiment.
6. Each of the videos taken is then analyzed, and the intial and final times are measured.

Discussion and conclusion

In the theory background section of the report, the given cross sectional area of a sphere is incorrect. The correct equation would be A = pi^2, while the given equation in the report is A = 4pi^2, which is the surface area of a sphere and not the cross sectional area for drag calculations. Beyond this correction, the purpose of the experiment is to determine whether the force of drag on small ball bearing falling through glycerine is linear or quadratic in speed. Based off the results found from the experiment and the proceding equations, the force of drag on small ball bearings falling through glycerine is found to be linear in speed. The R^2 from the graph of terminal velocity versus squared radius (linear drag test) was found to be closer in value to 1 than the R^2 from the graph of terminal velocity versus square root radius (quadratic drag test).
